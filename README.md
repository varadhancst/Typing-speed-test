# Typing-speed-test
test your typing speed

I developed a typing speed tester using Python and Tkinter. The program presents users with a passage of text and tracks their typing speed and accuracy as they type. The program calculates the user's words per minute (WPM) score and displays it along with a summary of any mistakes made. The program also includes options to customize the passage and adjust the difficulty level, which are accessed through a graphical user interface created using Tkinter. This project demonstrates my ability to use Tkinter to create a GUI and to design and implement a command-line application using Python and string manipulation and data processing techniques.
